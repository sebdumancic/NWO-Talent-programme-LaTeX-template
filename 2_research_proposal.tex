\subsection{Scientific and/or societal impact of the proposed project}\label{sec:KU}
% Describe the proposed impact of the research within the stated maximum number of words  (max. 1,000 words, please see the Explanatory Notes for further explanations).

\textcolor{nwotext}{Impact focus} \\
The impact focus of the project is as follows: 

% Choose one of these:
Primary focus on scientific impact 
% Scientific and societal impact are of comparable focus
% Primary focus on societal impact



\textcolor{nwotext}{Description of the impact of the proposed research}\\
When writing, please consider the following points:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Motivate your choice for the focus on scientific and/or societal impact;
	\item Elaborate on all applicable parts of the criteria for the chosen form of impact (see call for proposals);
	\item Indicate how attention will be paid to the non-chosen form of impact (thus, if the focus is on scientific impact, how attention is paid to possible or unforeseen societal impact of the research, and vice versa).
	\item Describe the key risks of undesirable societal impact and proposed measures to prevent or mitigate these risks. The requested description is a short and concise assessment and vision of the researcher.
\end{itemize}
